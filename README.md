## Introduction: 
This application was created to be used to organise daily work tasks during business hours. Technologies used to create this application include Local Storage, Jquery, HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Moment.js

The application can be accessed on: https://shash833.github.io/Daily-planner/

## Daily planner use: 
When the page is loaded, a planner featuring colour coded time rows is presented for the user to input their daily tasks. 
The daily planner is able to keep up to date with the use of Moment.js.

As shown above, rows are colour coded according to the current time. The user is able to type their tasks within the blocks which can be saved to the local storage which allows them to be displayed throughout the day. 
In the new working day, a fresh planner will be presented to the user.
